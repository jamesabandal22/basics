         <h4>Essay about my Self: A Journey of Self-Discovery</h4>

         <p>Hello I am James Kneechtel Sabandal, I was born and raised in Metro manila. I am an only child, therefore people tend to get the stereotypical impression that I am spoiled, but I disagree. I was raised to put others before myself and be considerate of their feelings. I was taught to always be happy and to not let anything or anybody bring me down and always have a positive view towards everything. Your point of view towards life says a lot about the person you are. I have always been very optimistic; I tend to see the good in everything and everybody. I believe that no matter what you are going through in life, there is always something good around the corner. This mindset impacts my behavior in a good way, it has helped me be very well aware of who I am and I believe this has allowed me to establish a strong foundation towards who I want to become. Many people have asked me how I am able to remain so positive all the time. My response to them is that it is very important to understand is that life goes on, regardless of what comes your way you need to stay strong through it all. It is not about how many times you get knocked down; it is about how many times you get back up and continue being strong. There have been multiple events and relationships that have affected me for some periods of time, but I have healed and continue to strive for improvement every day.</p>
